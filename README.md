# 🚀 RapidBase

*A No-Code Platform for Instant Database & Dashboard Generation*

## 📌 Overview

RapidBase is a **no-code platform** where anyone can visually create their own database and instantly get a professional dashboard to manage data—without writing a single line of code.

Instead of building a database, backend APIs, and an admin panel separately, RapidBase combines all of these into one **simple, fast, and automated platform**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Visual Schema Builder** – Drag-and-drop interface to create tables and columns with different data types.
* **Auto-Generated CRUD UI** – Instantly generated interface for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
* **Dynamic Data Dashboards** – Centralized dashboards with search, filter, and sort options.
* **Integrated Visualizations** – Auto-generated charts (bar, pie, line) for quick insights.
* **Secure Multi-User Collaboration** – Invite team members and assign roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
* **REST API Generation** – Expose secure API endpoints for advanced integrations.

## 💡 Use Case Example

A small business owner wants to track **customer orders**:

1. Creates a project called *Customer Orders*.
2. Adds a table `orders` with columns:

   * `customer_name (Text)`
   * `order_value (Number)`
   * `order_date (Date)`
   * `is_shipped (Boolean)`
3. RapidBase instantly provides:

   * A web UI for adding/updating orders.
   * A dashboard to view and filter orders.
   * A chart showing *Total Order Value per Day*.

All of this is done in under **15 minutes** with zero coding.

## ✅ Benefits

* Save weeks of development time.
* Empower non-developers to build tools.
* Rapid prototyping for MVPs.
* Centralized and secure data management.

## ⚠️ Challenges

* Complex core engine for schema generation.
* Security concerns in multi-tenant architecture.
* Scalability for thousands of projects.
* Risk of feature creep.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (multi-tenant, schema-per-project)
* **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), AWS/DigitalOcean (Backend & DB)
* **Charts/Graphs:** Recharts / Chart.js

---

## 🗄 Database Architecture

* **users** – Stores user info
* **projects** – Project definitions and schemas
* **project\_tables** – Metadata about user tables
* **table\_columns** – Column details
* **project\_members** – Collaboration roles
* **api\_keys** – Secure API access keys
* **audit\_log** – Security and debugging logs

Each project gets its own **isolated schema** for data security.

---

## 📅 Agile Timeline (4 Months)

* **Month 1 (MVP):** Authentication, project creation, schema builder, CRUD UI
* **Month 2:** Search, filters, validation, improved UX
* **Month 3:** Collaboration, visualizations, audit logs
* **Month 4:** REST APIs, API keys, testing, docs, beta launch

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Advanced data types (file uploads, rich text, color pickers).
* Database webhooks for external triggers.
* Pre-built templates (CRM, Task Tracker, Blog, etc.).
* Third-party integrations (Zapier, Stripe, Google Sheets).
* Drag-and-drop analytics dashboards.
